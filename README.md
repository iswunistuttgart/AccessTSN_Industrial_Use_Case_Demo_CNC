# AccessTSN Industrial Use Case Demo - CNC
This is a demonstration to give an example on how to use Linux with the current support for Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) as an industrial endpoint. For this purpose the components of this demonstration form a converged network use case in an industrial setting. 

The Use Case Demonstration is aimed at the AccessTSN Endpoint Image and is tested with but should also work independently from the image.

This work is a result of the AccessTSN-Project. More information on the project as well as contact information are on the project's webpage: https://accesstsn.com

## Structure of the Industrial Use Case Demo Git-projects

The AccessTSN Industrial Use Case Demo consists of multiple Git-projects, each holding the code to one component of the demonstration. This is the repository for the CNC control. It includes a module for Machinekit which writes control values from the Machinekit-HAL to a shared memory and the other way around. It also includes a setup for a 3-Axis mill as a demo machine. This setup is based on an example mill offered my LinuxCNC.

The main repository for AccessTSN Industrial Use Case Demo can be found on Github: https://github.com/iswunistuttgart/AccessTSN_Industrial_Use_Case_Demo


## Installation
### Prerequisites
Currently only Debian or a debian derived Linux distribution is supported to run Machinekit and LinuxCNC. For correct execution and performance a real-time extension is also necessary. This project was tested with rt-preempt. It is recommended to use the AccessTSN Endpoint Image as a base. 

The supplied configuration for LinuxCNC, called "AccessTSN 3axis Demo machine" uses a graphical user interface. The AccessTSN Endpoint Image does not include support for GUIs or a window manager. This needs to be installed as prerequisite. To keep the setup lightweight the XFCE4 desktop environment is recommended. It can be installed using apt:  
```sudo apt install xfce4```

### Installation of Machinekit and LinuxCNC
1. Clone or download this project to the destination folder on your hard drive.
2. Install Machinekit-HAL for rt-preempt (and it's dependencies) either using the build package at https://cloudsmith.io/~machinekit/repos/machinekit-hal/packages/ or compile from source (https://github.com/machinekit/machinekit-hal)
3. Install the LinuxCNC-EMC from the Machinekit Repository (and it's dependencies) either using the build package at https://cloudsmith.io/~machinekit/repos/emcapplication/packages/ or compile from source (https://github.com/machinekit/EMCApplication). Make sure to use compatible versions of Machinekit-HAL and EMCApplication. Tests were conducted with Machinekit-HAL version _0.4.20868-1_ and EMCApplication version _pre0.23585_ installed from packages (https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/machinekit/machinekit-hal/deb/debian/pool/buster/main/m/ma/machinekit-hal-rt-preempt_0.4.20868-1.gitca75c54aa~buster_amd64.deb and https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/machinekit/emcapplication/deb/debian/pool/buster/main/e/em/emcapplication_2.9.0~pre0.23585.git42bf973af~buster_amd64.deb).
4. Copy the _accesstsn.3axis_ subdirectory to the _linuxcnc/configs/_ subdirectory in your home directory
5. Compile and install the Machinekit-Component _accesstsnshm.comp_  
   Change to this projects folder  
   Compile and install the AccessTSN-Machinekit-Component (this needs root privileges):  

   ```sudo comp --install accesstsnshm.comp```

## Starting the CNC application

The CNC Application can be started using the commandline. Either directly specify the AccessTSN 3Axis Demo Machine   
```linuxcnc ~/linuxcnc/accesstsn.3axis/accesstsn_3axis.ini```  
or start the CNC Application without arguments  
```linuxcnc ```  
and use the LinuxCNC Configuration Selector (GUI) to chose the AccessTSN 3Axis machine.

Note: It is not possible to run the CNC Application with root privileges.


## Documentation
### AccessTSN Machinekit Component (_accesstsnshm.comp_)
The AccessTSN Machinekit Component is a Machinekit HAL Component which supplies the interface between the shared memory used in the AccessTSN Industrial Use Case Demo and die Machinekit HAL. For the development of the AccessTSN Machinekit Component the HAL Component generator is used. For information on the Machinekit HAL please see the Machinekit documentation (for writing HAl Components: http://www.machinekit.io/docs/hal/comp/). The functions _readin_ and _writeout_ of the HAL component are periodically executed and with each execution data from the shared memory is copied to the Machinekit HAL and vice versa. The component makes the Shared Memory Data available to the Machinekit HAL through its "pins".

### AccessTSN 3Axis Demo Machine
With this project a demo configuration for LinuxCNC is provided which represents a basic 3-axis milling machine. This AccessTSN 3Axis Demo Machine is aimed to be used together with the other projects of the AccessTSN Industrial Use Case. Therefore the values of the configuration match those of the axis simulation in the DriveControl project. The AccessTSN 3Axis Demo Machine can be found in the _accesstsn.3axis_ subdirectory. This demo configuration is based on the 3 Axis example included in the LinuxCNC project.
The (simulated) hardware setup is specified in the _accesstsn_3axs.hal_ file. There the AccessTSN Machinekit Component is used to interface with multiple Shared Memories which are used for data exchange between the different applications of the AccessTSN Industrial Use Case Demo. The HAL-file also specifies the other connections between the various HAL components. The AccessTSN 3Axis Demo machine uses simulated limit and home switches. The behavior and position of those switches is specified in _hallib/simulated_limits.hal_.
The parameters of the machine are specified in the _accesstsn_3axs.ini_ file. The basic parameters of the Demo Machine are listed in table 1:

| Parameter | Value |
|------------|:------------------:| 
|Unit |mm |
|Cycle Time (task controller)|0.001 s|
|Cycle Time (servo task) |1 ms |
|Number of Axis|3 (all identical)|
|Axis Setup |XYZ |
|Min position|-300 mm |
|Max position | 300 mm|
|Home position | 0 mm|
|Max velocity | 1 mm/s|
|Max acceleration | 508 mm/sÂ²|
|Tool change position | (0,0,300)|

Table 1: Basic parameters of AccessTSN 3 Axis Demo Machine

The available milling tools are specified in the _accesstsn_sim.tbl_ file. This can be extended if necessary. The chosen milling tool only has influence on the generated tool path and therefore on the set-point values, so no other parts of the AccessTSN Industrial Use Case Demo are affected by changes to this file. Table 2 lists the by default available milling tools.

| Toolnumber | Magazin position | Length in Z direction (mm) | Diameter (mm) | Description |
|:------------:|:------------------:| ----------------------:|----------:|-------------|
|T1 |P1 |0.511 |3 | 3mm end mill|
|T2 |P4 |0.1 |1.5 | 1.5mm end mill|
|T3 |P3 |1.273 |5 | 5mm tap mill|
|T4 |P2 |10 |16 | 16mm mill|
|T5 |P5 |25 |25 | 25mm mill|
|T6 |P6 |6 |6 | Tool6|
